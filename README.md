# browser-refresh package

Reloads browser from within the atom editor using keyboard shortcut `f5`. Tested on mac and linux.

On Mac, Chrome reload works without stealing focus. Firefox does steal focus though.

On Linux, you need to install `xdotool`. `sudo apt-get install xdotool` on ubuntu.

Commands to refresh browsers are taken from [sublime plugin](https://github.com/gcollazo/BrowserRefresh-Sublime)
